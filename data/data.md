# Datasets + Descriptions
## California Intercity Rail Routes - Amtrak
**Description**: This dataset shows three Amtrak intercity rail routes in California: the Pacific Surfliner, the San Joaquin Route, and the Capitol Corridor Route. I could overlay this data with flooding data, sea level rise projections, or other climate-related threats to see which routes are most at-risk.

## Coastal Inundation High 2FT
**Description**: This dataset depicts potential 2 FT sea level rise (SLR) and coastal flooding. I would be interested in overlaying the data with transportation routes in Southern California.
