## About Me
My name is Elena (she/her) and I am a first year MURP student concentrating in Regional & International Development and Transportation Planning & Policy. I was raised in Massachusetts and earned my B.A. in Hispanic Studies and Public Policy from Wheaton College (MA). Prior to starting at UCLA, I lived in San Diego for over five years where I worked in museum education and the non-profit sector. I enjoy playing tennis, going to the beach, reading, and spending time with my partner and our dog Yoda :dog: 
## Course Description + my objectives
**Course Description**

UP206A: Intro to GIS and Spatial Data Science introduces students to the foundations of spatial data science. During the quarter, we will learn the basics of Python programming and spatial analysis through geoprocessing. Each week, we will participate in programming lab sessions and respond to weekly or bi-weekly assignments as a way of thinking more critically about contemporary issues. By the end of the course, we will learn how to critically evaluate data, learn to produce high-quality and informative visualizations that inform policy, and more. 
**My objectives** for the course are to:

1. Establish a foundational knowledge of coding with Python
2. Apply learned techniques to create unique maps and other visualizations
3. Grow confidence in spatial data analysis
## Class Project Ideas
- Exploring the potential impact of anticipated sea level rise on public transportation systems in Southern California
- Mapping public transit options in LA communities where predominately indigenous languages are spoken
